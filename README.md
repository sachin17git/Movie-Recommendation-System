# Movie-Recommendation-System
### Restricted Boltzmann Machines using PyTorch
#  
### Objective of this model is to predict whether the user like the movie or not using Restricted Boltzmann Machines. This is an Unsupervised Learning approach. The movie dataset contains 1 Million movie rating corresponding to different users and movies. The training set and testing set has been divided in the ML-100k folder and has lot of different sets to train and work on.
